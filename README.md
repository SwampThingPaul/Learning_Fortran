# Learning Fortran
 Repository for my adventure learning Fortran

### Starters

*Install gfortran*
So far, the best guidance I found on how to install a fortran complier for a windows based system is from [Yutaka Masuda](https://masuday.github.io/fortran_tutorial/install_gfortran_windows.html). Still trying to figure out if things worked correctly. 


I decided to use VS Code ([Visual Code Studio](hhttps://code.visualstudio.com/)) as my program of choice to run/complie fortran code.
* In VS Code I am using the [Modern Fortran](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=krvajalm.linter-gfortran) plug-in.
* You still need a seperate complier to run any Fortran code, so I am experimenting with gfortran, see above. 

<!--* Something that might help with installing and configuring VS Code on a windows machine. [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw)-->

**Still working on configuring to run fortan...faceplam** 

Once you have things set up You Tube has been a fantastic resource. 
* Setting up VS Code for Fortran series is recommend but some additional reading/hunting is needed to get up to speed with the presenter. [Link](https://youtu.be/MZZLhodCzRY)
